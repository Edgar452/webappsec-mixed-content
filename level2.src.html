  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  When a user successfully loads a webpage from <code>example.com</code> over a
  secure channel (HTTPS, for example), the user is guaranteed that no entity
  between the user agent and <code>example.com</code> eavesdropped on or
  tampered with the data transmitted between them. However, this guarantee is
  weakened if the webpage loads subresources such as script or images over an
  insecure connection. For example, an insecurely-loaded script can allow an
  attacker to read or modify data on behalf of the user. An insecurely-loaded
  image can allow an attacker to communicate incorrect information to the user
  (e.g., a fabricated stock chart), mutate client-side state (e.g., set a
  cookie), or induce the user to take an unintended action (e.g., changing the
  label on a button). These requests are known as mixed content.

  [[!MIXED-CONTENT]] details how a user agent can mitigate these risks by
  blocking certain types of mixed content, and behaving more strictly in some
  contexts. This specification updates and extends [[!MIXED-CONTENT]] to provide
  better security and privacy guarantees while minimizing breakage.

  The core idea of this specification is <i>mixed content
  autoupgrading</i>. That is, mixed content that user agents are not already
  blocking should be autoupgraded to a secure transport. If the request cannot
  be autoupgraded, it will be blocked. Autoupgrading avoids loading insecure
  resources on secure webpages, while minimizing the amount of developer effort
  needed to avoid breakage.

    <h3 id="upgrade-algorithm">Upgrade |request| to an <i lang="la">a priori</i>
    authenticated URL as mixed content, if appropriate</h3>

    TODO. This algorithm is called from Fetch before blocking requests as mixed content. It checks if the request is optionally-blockable mixed content, and if so rewrites the scheme to HTTPS.
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="modifications">Modifications to existing algorithms</h3>

    TODO. Modify "Should fetching |request| be blocked as mixed content?" and "Should |response| to |request| be blocked as mixed content?" to ignore the optionally-blockable/blockable distinction. (All content that isn't autoupgraded should be blocked.)
</section>

  <h2 id="integration">Integrations</h2>

  TODO. Call the autoupgrading algorithm from Fetch.

  TODO. Something about blocking insecure downloads from secure contexts (integrate with HTML).

<section>
  <h2 id="obsolescences">Obsolescences</h2>

  TODO. block-all-mixed-content is obsolete. Clarify the value of
  upgrade-insecure-requests (upgrades blockable content as well as
  optionally-blockable).
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

  TODO. Discuss the possibility of autoupgrading to an unintended resource that might introduce a security issue.
